\title{Calculate ranking by stock status}
\usage{
summarize_stock_status(abundance, species, years, model_loc = "model_files")
}
\arguments{
\item{abundance}{R data object that contains the estimated abundance by species.
This function takes the existing values and adds the estimated abundance from
new assessments. The csv file to be read is found in the data-processessed folder
called abundance_processed.csv}

\item{species}{R data object that contains a list of species names to calculate
assessment prioritization.  The csv file with the list of species names should be
stored in the data-raw folder ("species_names.csv")}

\item{years}{Vector of specific years to calculate the mean age of the catches by species.}

\item{model_loc}{Directory location to locate model files. The default is "model_files" in the
assessment prioritization github.}
}
\description{
Function that will read output from all models in
the model_loc ("model_files") folder. The unfished
spawning biomass, final spawning biomass, sigma R,
assessment year, and mean age. The function then takes
these results and calculates a weighted depletion and
mean age for stocks with area based assessments. These
results are then added to the previous cycle's stock status
and assessment frequency sheets in the "data" folder. The
updated stock status and assessment frequency csv files are
then saved to the tables folder.
