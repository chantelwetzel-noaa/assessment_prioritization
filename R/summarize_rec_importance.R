#' Summarize and format recreational catch data to be used along with recreational
#' importance scores to calculate the 'pseudo revenue' by species for the recreational fishery.  
#' The function currently uses an existing csv file with previously calculated recreational
#' importance to access existing relative weights for each species and state. In the future
#' this should be modified in the future to use a stand-alone file containing the recreational
#' species weights by state that should be saved in the "data" folder.
#'
#' @param file_name A csv file pulled from RecFIN with recreational catches.
#' data. Found in the data folder in the assessment prioritization github repo.
#' @param species_file A csv including all species to calculate values for.
#' @param years A vector of years to calculate the average recreational catch
#' across.
#' @param max_exp A numerical value to apply as an exponent to the coastwide
#' pseudo revenue score. Default value of 0.18.
