# Introduction

This document provides a detailed description of the analysis that is intended to provide the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and advisory bodies guidance on species-specific assessment prioritization by synthesizing information from commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries, stock status, and other attributes defined as "Factors".  The methodology presented here follows the general framework advanced in the 2015 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Technical Memorandum, ["Prioritizing Fish Stock Assessments"](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/Assets/stock/documents/PrioritizingFishStockAssessments_FinalWeb.pdf) [@methot_prioritizing_2015].  

This process was envisioned as a way of synthesizing a broad range of relevant information in a manner that can, over time, provide improved guidance, primarily on which species should be considered for benchmark (i.e., full) assessments, or subsequent stock assessment updates. The ranking process provides a useful tool for focusing discussion on species where a new assessment may have the greatest impact, but it is not a replacement for the judgment of the Council and advisory bodies. An important consideration for selecting any species for assessment is whether the (potentially) available data (e.g., trend and length- and age-composition data) are adequate to conduct the desired level of assessment. This aspect of prioritization is not scored in the way other factors are, and so must be considered independently, at this time.  In that regard, the process is likely to help identify important data gaps and/or situations where a data-moderate approach should be undertaken with whatever data are available.

The scoring and weighting of Factors in the associated Excel workbook, "NMFS Assessment Prioritization Workbook", remains a work in progress, particularly as we consider its ability, as currently configured, to provide useful insight into priorities in subsequent cycles, as requested by the Council. There may be important considerations that are not encompassed by any of the existing factors, or the methods by which Factor Scores are derived or weighted may be identified as needing improvement.  As consideration of priorities for `r ass_yr` are considered this spring it will be important to identify any parts of the scoring that could be improved.  As aspects of management change, this framework should adapt to reflect the manner in which those changes affect prioritization.  

The NMFS Assessment Prioritization Workbook that accompanies this document begins with an Overview tab, followed by a Summary tab in which the Factor Scores are assembled and multiplied by the base-case weights, resulting in a total score and ranking.  Those are followed by a tab for each Factor, which documents the Factor scores and ranks for each species. The following text provides a description of the content and issues associated with each tab, along with the source of data and information used in scoring each Factor.
