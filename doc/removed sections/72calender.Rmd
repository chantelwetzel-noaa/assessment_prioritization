## 2025 Assessment Calendar 

The 2025 assessment planning calendar identifies potential weeks in which Stock Assessment Review (STAR) panels could potentially be scheduled. Based on the expected availability of 2024 data and the time needed for model development and documentation, it is unlikely that any benchmark assessments could be reviewed before May. As of January 2024, the 2025 June and September Pacific Fishery Management Council meeting dates have not been confirmed. Once those meeting dates are available, these weeks will be shaded and potential STAR panel weeks will be finalized.
