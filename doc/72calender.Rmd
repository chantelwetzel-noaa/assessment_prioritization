## 2023 Assessment Calendar 

The following tab in the workbook presents an annotated 2023 assessment planning calendar
that identifies potential weeks in which STAR panels can be scheduled. Based on the expected availability of 2022 data and the time needed for model development and documentation, it is unlikely that any full assessments could be reviewed before May. As of January 2022, the June and September Pacific Fishery Management Council meeting date have not been announced.  Once meeting dates for June and September 2023 are available these weeks will be shaded and potential STAR panel weeks will be finalized.
