## 2025 Assessment Calendar 

The following tab in the workbook presents an annotated 2025 assessment planning calendar
that identifies potential weeks in which STAR panels can be scheduled. Based on the expected availability of 2024 data and the time needed for model development and documentation, it is unlikely that any benchmark assessments could be reviewed before May. As of January 2024, the June and September Pacific Fishery Management Council meeting date have not been announced.  Once meeting dates for June and September 2025 are available these weeks will be shaded and potential STAR panel weeks will be finalized.
