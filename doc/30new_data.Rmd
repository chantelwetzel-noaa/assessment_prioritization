## Relevant New Types of Information Available

As new types or sources of useful information or methods become available for a species, the potential value of conducting a new assessment for it increases. The scoring of this Factor has been broken down into three categories. The first two categories are for new sources of trend information and for information, such as length, age, maturity data, or genetic research that help inform stock structure or population dynamics in an assessment. Although these categories are intended to focus on new sources of information, some points have been assigned where there are significant amounts of new data from existing sources since the last benchmark or update assessment, as well as to species without major assessments. Points are assigned in the last category where issues or problems identified during the review of prior assessments can now be addressed through the inclusion of newly available data or methods. The scoring for each of the items included in this component are somewhat subjective.  The overall scoring for this factor is calculated as:

$$
n_s = \text{Trend}_s + \text{Stock Structure}_s + \text{Issues}_s
$$

The categories of new information and potential scores are shown in Table \ref{tab:new-info}.

<!-- THINK THE STEEPNESS FACTOR SHOULD BE ELIMINATED: 2009 = 0.69, 2011 = 0.76, 2013 = 0.78, 2015 = 0.77, 2017+ = 0.72
The first category of new information involves the treatment of the steepness parameter used to inform stock productivity in rockfish assessments. The assumed value for rockfish steepness was historically variable but the value used in rockfish assessments  generally increased steadily between 2007 (steepness = 0.58) through 2015 (0.77) and since 2017 has been a constant a value of 0.72.
