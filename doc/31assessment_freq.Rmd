## Assessment Frequency

The the assessment frequency factor determines how often each species should be assessed based on biology (i.e., target assessment frequency), evaluates how long it has been since the most recent assessment if available, and if the time since the most recent assessment is beyond the assessment frequency. There is addition consideration for any species where the last assessment was conducted more than ten years ago given the national guidance in calculating the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI). 

The target assessment frequency is determined based upon maximum age that is then modified based upon the importance of a species to the fishery and the ecosystem, along with the assumed variation in recruitment. Using maximum age in the calculation to determine target assessment frequency is a departure from the recommended approach in the national guidance [@methot_prioritizing_2015] and how it was conducted in previous cycles which followed that guidance. The previous approach used estimated mean age of the catch from the most recent assessment to determine the initial target assessment frequency (e.g., the value calculation prior to applying adjustments) and then was adjusted based upon modifiers. There are two issues with this approach. First, the mean age of the catch is more reflective of fishery exploitation and could decrease or increase if there were strong or weak recruitment events moving through the population. The second main issue is that unassessed species lack an estimate of the mean age in the catch with these species being assigned a single default target assessment frequency regardless of the biology of the species. Moving to use maximum age provides multiple advantages. It more reflective of life history which the target assessment frequency is attempting to capture in that short lives species with fast population dynamics you may need to assess them more frequently compared to a long lived species. Additionally, for species that have not been assessed a literature search can be conducted to determine maximum age.   

Determining the target assessment frequency involves two steps.  First, the maximum age is adjusted based on fishery importance, ecosystem importance, and assumed variation in recruitment as described below. The adjustments to the maximum age based on fisheries importance, and the ecosystem importance, and assumed variation in recruitment can be either -0.2, 0, or +0.2 for each adjustment.  For recruitment variability, species with that exhibit a high degree of recruitment variability  ($\sigma_R > 0.9$) receive a value of -0.2, low variability species ($\sigma_R < 0.30$) receive a +0.2, with others receiving values of 0. For the fishery and ecosystem importance scores, the top-third of each receive a -0.2, the bottom-third a +0.2, and the rest 0. The fishery importance is determined based upon the summed importance across the commercial, recreational, and tribal importance factors. The combined score based on the recruitment variability $r_s$, fishery importance $f_s$, and ecosystem importance $e_s$ are multiplied with the adjusted maximum age calculated as:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{adjusted maximum age}_s = 
\text{maximum age}_s * (1 + r_s + f_s + e_s) 
\end{aligned}
$$
The 25, 50, and 75th quantiles are then calculated for the adjusted maximum ages. The adjusted maximum ages are then assigned a target assessemnt frequency based upon where they fall within the quantiles where adjusted maximum ages that fall within below the 25th quantile are assigned a 4 year target assessment frequency, 25th-50th a 6 year target assessment frequency, 50th-75th a 8 year target assessment frequency, and, 75th and greater a 10 year target assessment frequency.  The target assessment frequency of 4, 6, 8, and 10 were selected due to the groundfish biennium cycle with a minimum value of 4 due to the large number of species in the groundfish FMP, and a maximum value of 10 due to FSSI guidance around ensuring assessments are conducted at least every 10 years.  

The number of years a stock is "overdue" for assessment is calculated as the difference between the years since the last assessment and the target assessment frequency (with a minimum value of zero). An additional point of +1 is added for a species if the most recent assessment was conducted within the last 6 years and the SSC indicated that an update assessment could be conducted and if the time since the last assessment is greater than ten year. The assessment frequency factor score is calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_s = max(\text{Years Since Last Assessment}_s - \text{Target Assessment Frequency}_s, 0) + \\ \text{Assessment Can be Updated}_s + \text{Greater Than 10 Years Since Last Assessment}_s 
\end{aligned}
$$

The assessment frequency score is then standardized to a maximum value of 10.
