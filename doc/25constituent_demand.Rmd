## Constituent Demand and Choke Species

This Factor includes aspects of species importance that are less easily quantified through formulaic transformation of fisheries data. Constituent Demand is intended to capture elements of fishery importance that are not adequately captured by the scoring for the commercial and recreational fisheries on a coastwide basis. Four elements are currently reflected in the scoring of this component, two of which capture situations in which a species is considerably more important to a segment of the commercial or recreational fishery than is reflected in the coastwide scoring of those Factors.  There are different numbers of species present in the catch of each state/fleet and all species with zero catch have been assigned an intermediate commercial or recreational state or gea rank of 57, in order to better facilitate comparison. Those are accompanied by additional columns showing the differences between the coastwide and each state's/fleet's values.  

Initial evaluation of the significance of differences is indicated by values ranging generally from 2-0 for the commercial and recreational fleets, respectively. The third element provides an opportunity to elevate scores for "species of concern" that have been identified by stakeholders. One example of such concern might be rapid changes in the availability of a species to fishermen in a particular area.  The final component reflects the degree to which the 5-year catch histories (used in scoring the Commercial, Recreational, and Tribal Factors) of species were reduced as a result of rebuilding, or post-rebuilding caution, in the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs).  Input from the Council family and public regarding areas of importance or concern relevant to this tab is encouraged.  The scoring or each of the above described components generally ranges between 0-2 with higher scores indicating greater impact to either the commercial or recreational fishery. 

The overall ranking for Constituent Demand and Choke Species is calculated as:

\begin{centering}

$d_s = \text{Choke Stock}_s + \text{Commerical Importance}_s + \text{Recreational Importance}_s + \text{Rebuilding Impact on Landings}_s + \text{Industry Concern}_s$

\end{centering}
