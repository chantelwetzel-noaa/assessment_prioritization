## Constituent Demand

This Factor includes aspects of species importance that are less easily quantified through formulaic transformation of fisheries data. Constituent Demand is intended to capture elements of fishery importance that are not adequately captured by the scoring for the commercial and recreational fisheries on a coastwide basis.

Six elements are currently reflected in the scoring of this component. The first two components capture situations in which a species is considerably more important to a segment of the commercial or recreational fishery than is reflected in the coastwide scoring of those Factors. There are different numbers of species present in the commercial and recreational catch from each state and or gear and all species with zero catch for a specific combination (e.g., zero commercial catch in Washington state) have been assigned the highest numerical rank (i.e., lower numerical ranking indicates species with a high constituent demand and or choke species). Those are accompanied by additional columns showing the differences between the coastwide and each state’s/fleet’s values. Initial evaluation of the significance of differences between state/fleet values and the coastwide values is indicated by numerical scoring ranging generally from 2.0-0 where a higher value indicates a greater difference between the state/fleet and coastwide importance.

The third element provides an opportunity to elevate scores for "species of concern" that have been identified by stakeholders. One example of such concern might be rapid changes in the availability of a species to fishermen in a particular area. The fourth component reflects the degree to which the 5-year catch histories (used in scoring the Commercial, Recreational, and Tribal Factors) of species were reduced as a result of rebuilding, or post-rebuilding caution, in the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs).The fifth scoring element is a measure of the impact that a species specific ACLs may result in a constraint on opportunities across the groundfish fishery (termed 'choke stock'). An example of a choke stock would be a stock managed via a rebuilding plan resulting in low ACLs and this stock is present across areas of the coast making avoidance difficult without potentially forgoing catches of other co-occurring stock. The final scoring element is based on the potential future limiting specification. A modifier value is calculated based on the percent attainment between recent average mortality to future ACL values (see Section \ref{future-spex-sec} for details). Modifier values range between -2.0 to +4.0 with a value of 4 being given to species with potential future attainments greater than 100 percent or stocks are managed under a rebuilding plan.  

Input from the Council family and public regarding areas of importance or concern relevant to this tab is encouraged. The scoring or each of the above described components generally ranges between 0.0-2.0 with higher scores indicating greater impact to either the commercial or recreational fishery.

The overall score for Constituent Demand and Choke Species is calculated as:

\begin{centering}

$d_s = \text{Choke Stock}_s + \text{Commercial Importance}_s + \text{Recreational Importance}_s + \text{Rebuilding Impact on Landings}_s + \text{Industry Concern}_s + \text{Future Limiting}_s$

\end{centering}
