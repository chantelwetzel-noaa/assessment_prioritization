## Commercial Importance

The commercial importance score is based on the coastwide ex-vessel revenue generated by commercial landings of groundfish during the period `r start.yr`- `r end.yr`. The raw revenue amounts generally have a very large range across goundfish species.  Consequently, a transformation is used to compress the distribution and reduce the differences between species.  

As in `r sum.yr - 2`, a 2-stage logarithmic transformation is used to compress and rescale the distribution (to a high score of 10, using the following approach:

\begin{centering}

  $c_{s} = \frac{10}{\text{max}(\text{Revenue}_s)}\text{Revenue}_s^{0.18} $

\end{centering}

where Revenue is the total commercial ex-vessel revenue across the summarizing years for each species $s$. Revenue amounts included in this scoring do not include sales of Tribally-caught groundfish. Those are included in a separate Tribal calculation.
