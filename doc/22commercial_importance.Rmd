## Commercial Importance

The commercial importance score is based on the coastwide ex-vessel revenue generated by commercial landings of groundfish during the period `r start_yr` - `r end_yr`. The raw revenue amounts generally have a very large range across groundfish species.  Consequently, a transformation is used to compress the distribution and reduce the differences between species.  

A two-stage logarithmic transformation is used to compress and rescale the distribution, to a high score of 10, using the following approach:

\begin{equation}
  c_{s} = \frac{10}{\text{max}(\text{Revenue}_s^{0.18})}\text{Revenue}_s^{0.18} 
\end{equation}

where Revenue is the total commercial ex-vessel revenue across the summarizing years for each species $s$. Revenue amounts are obtained from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN). Revenue amounts included in this scoring do not include sales of Tribally-caught groundfish. Those are included in a separate Tribal calculation.
